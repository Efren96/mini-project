# Homework Week One: Horiseon Website Update

## About Project 

We were given starter code, a screenshot of the website and acceptance criteria on what was required to complete this project.

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.


* Then I went over the acceptance criteria and started adjusting the starter code that was provided by the instructor from beginning to end. 

* I commited changes as I made them.

* Once I finished going over the acceptance criteria and felt like everything was up to standards I pushed the code to my GitHub repository
